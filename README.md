This is my first project as a web developer. 

I aways thought the netflix's main interface an interesting object of study. So, for my first project, i used a challenge that college gave me to re-imagine the netflix design.

This challenge is focused on building a site that manipulates a school canteen, with three subjects: employees, parents and students. The main interface is the students one.
Some pages are still in development. Be free to send me tips and sugestions :))
